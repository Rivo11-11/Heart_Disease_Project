# Heart_Disease_Project
The project "heart_disease" focuses on machine learning and data analysis techniques to predict the presence of heart disease. The project begins with a thorough data exploration and cleaning phase to ensure the data is ready for analysis and model training.

Using three different machine learning models, the project aims to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not, with the target variable having two classes. The models are trained on a set of selected features that are considered relevant for identifying heart disease.

To optimize the models' performance, hyperparameter tuning is applied using techniques such as Randomized Search and Grid Search. This process helps identify the best combination of hyperparameters for each model, maximizing their predictive capabilities.

Evaluation of the models' performance is done using various performance metrics such as the classification report, ROC curve, and confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into the models' accuracy, precision, recall, and other important indicators.

The project identifies the most critical features for predicting heart disease. By examining the feature importance, it becomes clear which factors play a significant role in determining the presence of the disease.

Throughout the project, the ultimate goal is to achieve the highest possible accuracy in identifying heart disease patients. After applying the logistic regression model with tuned hyperparameters, the project successfully achieves an accuracy of 88%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting the presence of heart disease based on the selected features.
